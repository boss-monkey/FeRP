    This program is the supplementary files of the paper: “Flash evaporation Riemann Problem: Formulation and its Exact Solution”.
    This program calculates the exact solutions of the Flash evaporation Riemann Problem of two-parameter fluid based on PR EoS.
    The "main" file is the solver, in which the initial conditions of the Riemann problem are input.
    The "cal_critical_parameter" file is used to input the physical properties of the fluid.
Detailed comments are provided in each of the other program files.

Please note that the paper has not yet been published. Currently, only 10 subroutines from the program are available on this website. The remaining subroutines will be uploaded once the paper is published.
